# README

    This is a WireShark dissector to decode the Minecraft protocol.  It is 
    incomplete but useless. Especially you should keep these words from the 
    license in mind:

# HOWTO

    run Make in the directory

    it expects /usr/include/wireshark to exist, on ubuntu aptitude install wireshark-dev

    It should copy the plugin to ~/.wireshark/plugins, and then loading a wireshark packet dump should decode the packet types.

    When I tested, I used a tcpdump with full packets, I'd recommend the same or things will probably break.

    ex:
    tcpdump -w minecraft.dump -s 0 'port 25565'
